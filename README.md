# odin-recipes
i have created a website containing recipes for a few different meals (not my recipes!)
I incorporated lists, images, headings, and hyperlinks to create my website.
Using git with github was challenging. I restarted after 20 mins of beginnig the project as I hadn't cloned the git onto my local drive correctly.
The project helped me consolidate what I have learned so far because my hand was no longer being held so I had to figure out and understand things myself.
